# Kerotan and GA-KO Checker <span style="color: #009600;">Î”</span>

A website where you can upload your Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater save file and see which Kerotans and GA-KO have you missed.

I made it because after a long run where I tried to find every collectable, I ended up with 63 GA-KO and I was not feeling like doing all of this again to find one duck.

Reads your `UserProfile_0.sav` file and shows you which collectable Kerotans and GA-KO you are missing.
